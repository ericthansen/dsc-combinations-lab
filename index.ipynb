In the previous lab, you saw how the order was important when using permutations. Cracking a code is one example, but what if the order doesn't matter, for example, when an engaged couple wants to pick 3 wedding cakes from a list of 15? You'll need to use another technique here, and this is where combinations come in handy!\n\n## Objectives\n\nYou will be able to: \n\n* Decide whether or not permutations and combinations are required for a given problem\n* Use Python to calculate combinations and permutations\n\n\n## Let's get started\n\nFrom the previous lab, you remember that we created a factorial function.\n\nNow, let's use this factorial function to create a function `combination` as well as `permutation`, both holding 2 arguments n and k."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def factorial(n):\n    prod = 1\n    while n >= 1:\n        prod = prod * n\n        n = n - 1\n    return prod","execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def permutation(n,k):\n    return factorial(n)/(factorial(n-k))","execution_count":3,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def combination(n,k):\n    return factorial(n)/(factorial(n-k)*factorial(k))","execution_count":4,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Great!
